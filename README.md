## Introduction

**kentsislab/proteomegenerator3** is a bioinformatics pipeline that can be used to create sample-specific, proteogenomics search databases from long-read RNAseq data. It takes in a samplesheet and aligned long-read RNAseq data as input, performs guided, de novo transcript assembly, ORF prediction, and then produces a protein fasta file suitable for use with computational proteomics search platforms (e.g, Fragpipe, DIA-NN).

<!-- TODO nf-core:
   Complete this sentence with a 2-3 sentence summary of what types of data the pipeline ingests, a brief overview of the
   major pipeline sections and the types of output it produces. You're giving an overview to someone new
   to nf-core here, in 15-20 seconds. For an example, see https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/master/README.md#introduction
-->

<!-- TODO nf-core: Include a figure that guides the user through the major workflow steps. Many nf-core
     workflows use the "tube map" design for that. See https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/design_guidelines#examples for examples.   -->
<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->

1. Pre-processing of aligned reads to create transcript read classes with [bambu](https://github.com/GoekeLab/bambu) which can be re-used in future analyses. Optional filtering:
   1. Filtering on MAPQ and read length with [samtools](https://www.htslib.org/)
2. Transcript assembly, quantification, and filtering with [bambu](https://github.com/GoekeLab/bambu). Option to merge multiple samples into a unified transcriptome.
3. ORF prediction with [Transdecoder](https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder).
4. Formatting of ORFs into a UniProt-style fasta file which can be used for computational proteomics searchs with [Fragpipe](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/), [DIA-NN](https://github.com/vdemichev/DiaNN), [Spectronaut](https://biognosys.com/software/spectronaut/).
5. Concatenation of sample-specific proteome fasta produced in #4 with a UniProt proteome of the user's choice to allow for spectra to compete between non-canonical and canonical proteoforms.
6. Deduplication of sequences and basic statistics with [seqkit](https://bioinf.shenwei.me/seqkit/usage/#quick-guide)
7. MultiQC to collate package versions used ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data. When using the profile, it will run on a minimal test dataset that can be run in 5-10 minutes on most modern laptops.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
subject_id,sample_id,sequence_type,filetype,filepath
PATIENT1,SAMPLE1,long_read,bam,/path/to/sample1.bam
PATIENT1,SAMPLE1,long_read,rc_file,/path/to/sample1.rds
PATIENT1,SAMPLE1,fusion,tsv,/path/to/sample1_fusions.tsv
PATIENT1,SAMPLE2,long_read,bam,/path/to/sample2.bam
```

Each row represents a single file associated with a sample. The columns are as follows:

| Column          | Required | Values                              | Description                |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `subject_id`    | Yes      | String (no spaces)                  | Subject/patient identifier |
| `sample_id`     | Yes      | String (no spaces)                  | Sample identifier          |
| `sequence_type` | Yes      | `long_read`, `short_read`, `fusion` | Data modality              |
| `filetype`      | Yes      | `bam`, `rc_file`, `tsv`             | File format                |
| `filepath`      | Yes      | File path                           | Path to the file           |

**Requirements:**

- Every sample MUST have at least one `long_read` + `bam` entry
- `rc_file` entries are optional; use with `--skip_preprocessing` flag to speed up runtime by reusing Bambu read classes from previous runs
- `fusion` entries require the `--fusions` flag to be processed
- `short_read` entries require the `--short_reads` flag to be processed

To produce the necessary files, we recommend using the [nf-core/nanoseq](https://nf-co.re/nanoseq/3.1.0/) pipeline for alignment, or [ctat-lr-fusion](https://github.com/TrinityCTAT/CTAT-LR-fusion) for fusion calling.

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

<!-- TODO nf-core: update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->

```bash
nextflow run kentsislab/proteomegenerator3 -r 1.2.0 \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --fasta <REF_GENOME> \
   --gtf <REF_GTF> \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

Where `REF_GENOME` and `REF_GTF` are the reference genome and transcriptome respectively. These can be from GENCODE or Ensembl, but should match the reference used to align the data.

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

### Additional parameters

To see all optional parameters that could be used with the pipeline and their explanations, use the help menu:

```bash
nextflow run kentsislab/proteomegenerator3 -r 1.2.0 --help
```

This options can be run using flags. For example:

```bash
nextflow run kentsislab/proteomegenerator3 -r 1.2.0 \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --fasta <REF_GENOME> \
   --gtf <REF_GTF> \
   --outdir <OUTDIR> \
   --filter_reads
```

Will pre-filter the bam file before transcript assembly is performed on mapq and read length.

As another example, you can skip multi-sample transcript merging and process each sample independently:

```bash
nextflow run kentsislab/proteomegenerator3 -r 1.2.0 \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --fasta <REF_GENOME> \
   --gtf <REF_GTF> \
   --outdir <OUTDIR> \
   --skip_multisample
```

To include fusion predictions from ctat-lr-fusion in your proteome database, use the `--fusions` flag:

```bash
nextflow run kentsislab/proteomegenerator3 -r 1.2.0 \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --fasta <REF_GENOME> \
   --gtf <REF_GTF> \
   --outdir <OUTDIR> \
   --fusions
```

Note that when using `--fusions`, your samplesheet must include `fusion` + `tsv` entries with paths to ctat-lr-fusion output files. If fusion files are not provided for a sample, the pipeline will automatically skip fusion processing for that sample.

To include short-read RNA-seq data for complementary transcript assembly, use the `--short_reads` flag:

```bash
nextflow run kentsislab/proteomegenerator3 -r 1.2.0 \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --fasta <REF_GENOME> \
   --gtf <REF_GTF> \
   --outdir <OUTDIR> \
   --short_reads
```

When using `--short_reads`, your samplesheet should include `short_read` + `bam` entries:

```csv
subject_id,sample_id,sequence_type,filetype,filepath
PATIENT1,SAMPLE1,long_read,bam,/path/to/sample1_longread.bam
PATIENT1,SAMPLE1,short_read,bam,/path/to/sample1_shortread.bam
```

Short-read transcripts are assembled using StringTie and the resulting ORF predictions are merged with long-read (Bambu) predictions in the final proteome database.

To run with the latest version, which may not be stable you can use the `-r dev -latest` flags:

```bash
nextflow run kentsislab/proteomegenerator3 -r dev -latest --help
```

I have highlighted the following options here:

1. `filter_reads`: use this flag to pre-filter reads using mapq and read length
2. `mapq`: min mapq for read filtering [default: 20]
3. `read_len`: min read length for read filtering [default: 500]
4. `filter_acc_reads`: filter reads on accessory chromosomes; sometimes causes issues for bambu
5. `skip_preprocessing`: use previously generated bambu read classes
6. `NDR`: modulate bambu's novel discovery rate [default: 0.1]
7. `recommended_NDR`: run bambu with recommended NDR (as determined by bambu's algorithm)
8. `skip_multisample`: skip multi-sample transcript merging and process samples individually
9. `single_best_only`: select only the single best ORF per transcript [default: false]
10. `fusions`: enable processing of fusion predictions from ctat-lr-fusion [default: false]. When enabled, fusion ORFs will be included in the final proteome database. Requires `fusion` + `tsv` entries in samplesheet pointing to ctat-lr-fusion output files.
11. `short_reads`: enable short-read RNA-seq assembly and quantification with StringTie [default: false]. Requires `short_read` + `bam` entries in samplesheet pointing to aligned short-read BAM files. Short-read transcripts are assembled independently and merged with long-read predictions in the final proteome database.
12. `uniprot_proteome`: local path to UniProt proteome for (i) BLAST-based ORF validation in Transdecoder subworkflow and (ii) concatenation of the final proteome fasta file.
13. `UPID`: UniProt proteome ID (UPID) for automated download (if no local path was provided with option #12) [default: UP000005640]
